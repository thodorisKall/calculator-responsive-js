# Responsive JS Calculator

## 1. Goal of the Project

The objective of this project is to practice and enhance understanding of Vanilla JavaScript and programming logic while creating a responsive layout. The idea is to build a functional and interactive calculator similar to the iOS 7 calculator design.

## 2. Project Deployment

The project is currently deployed using Vercel and can be accessed at this URL: [https://calculator-responsive-js.vercel.app/](https://calculator-responsive-js.vercel.app/)

## 3. Description

This project aims to create a calculator with a design and keyboard grid similar to the iOS 7 calculator. The calculator is built using pure JavaScript, without relying on any libraries or frameworks. It features a complete responsive design, ensuring compatibility and accessibility across all screen sizes and widths.

## 4. Outcome

The outcome of this project is a fully functional calculator with a sleek design similar to the iOS 7 calculator. It showcases the capability to build interactive applications using Vanilla JavaScript and apply sound programming logic. The calculator's responsive design demonstrates the understanding of modern web design principles, ensuring a seamless user experience across all device types.

## 5. Technology Stack

The technology stack used for this project includes:

- HTML5: Used for structuring the calculator's layout.
- CSS3 with BEM naming: Utilized for styling the calculator and making it responsive.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Employed for handling the calculator's functionality and interactivity.

## 6. Vision

The vision for this project is to continuously enhance the calculator's functionality by adding new features, thus creating a more engaging user experience. As the project progresses, it will serve as a practical learning platform for exploring more advanced JavaScript topics and experimenting with different programming paradigms.

## 7. Stage of the Project

The current stage of the project is in progress. The basic functionality of the calculator is complete, and it is live for use. However, more features will be added in the future to further refine the project and expand its capabilities. Keep an eye out for future updates!
